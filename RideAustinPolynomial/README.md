PolynomialWeekly.py is a Python3 analysis of RideAustin's daily ride requests, identifying a weekly cycle in total request volume. The data released covers rides requested from June 16 to August 31, just over 11 weeks. It shows a clear cycle weekly, typically with peak ride demand on Saturday. I model this cycle as a spliced polynomial which closely adheres to the data.
