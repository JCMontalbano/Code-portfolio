PolynomialWeekly.py is a Jupyter Notebook analysis of RideAustin's daily ride request volume, identifying a weekly cycle. The data released covers rides requested from June 16 to August 31, just over 11 weeks. It shows a clear cycle weekly, typically with peak ride demand on Saturday. I model this cycle as a spliced set of 7 polynomial curve fits and achieve close fit.
