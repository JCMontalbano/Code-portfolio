## 3PL Predictive Routing Research & Development Proposal:

We can compete well with other 3PLs by solving for the KPIs of the shippers and the truckers. Truckers want to maximize income per mile driven, while satisfying requirements like the 80/7 rule; shippers want to minimize cost per mile while satisfying drayage needs. If we analyze your event data for recurring cycles - i.e. weekly, monthly, seasonal and yearly recurring trends in demand, we can model the demand geospatially across our grid. By predicting where demand will be ahead of time, we can incentivize our freight carriers to move their trucks to our high demand areas, maximizing our drayage on offer to our shippers.

**For a working iPython notebook of my code using curve-fitting to model a weekly trend in a single variable, see here:** [RideAustinPolynomial](https://github.com/JCMontalbano/Code-portfolio/tree/master/RideAustinPolynomial). This technique should be applied to individual shippers, and to industries broadly, to predict demand. This demand can then be modeled geospatially using the historical points of shipping origin for those industries, as well as specific histories of those points of origin.

**For a writeup modeling and visualizing a daily trend from historical data in a datetime and latitude/longitude context, see here:** 
[Ride|Austin Saturday Traffic Distribution](http://www.eosmath.com/2017/05/rideaustin-saturday-traffic-distribution.html). This density demand map of the city, shifting with time, allows for geospatial, time-specific predictions of future demand.

Having identified time and geospatial trends in your shipping data, we can predict (with some uncertainty) the future value of a trucker's position at the end of their transit time. This allows us to route truckers toward positions which will keep them working on the next job or back haul. We can then direct our trucks toward regions which have a large number of possible or likely jobs, even before we've received orders for these jobs. If truckers can count on your 3PL to route them toward reliable work, they can neglect other 3PLs, and we acquire a larger workforce to offer our shippers, which in turn improves the performance we can offer to them. 

I've already implemented a mathematically similar solution at [Ridemap](https://ridemap.ai). Ridemap's map is a 6 dimensional histogram of historical rideshare data, displayed as a heatmap sliced for current time and date, where two dimensions are lat/lon, three are positions in the time cycles, and one is the dependent variable. Ridemap's 'auto-navigate' feature involves a weighted k-means cluster implemented in React for Android and iOS. We can easily implement similar math in Java or even C, depending on what your 3PL's servers run (I've also written it in Python). 

**For a great little animation explaining the K-means cluster algorithm (0:59), click here:** [k-means clustering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I3Ei69I40s). This unsupervised algorithm identifies naturally occuring centers in data, and works well in lat/lon context. 

**For an example of using k-means clusters to successfully predict stochastic demand centers from a historical record, see here:** [K-Means Clustering of Rideshare providers leads to better performance; how an Austin startup can compete with the giants using machine learning
](http://www.eosmath.com/2017/06/k-means-clustering-of-rideshare.html) Here we used historical rideshare data to predictively place rideshare drivers, resulting in a 33% decrease in arrival delay. This technology is similar to that which we used in RideMap's final product.

### Modeling your data in this way also allows the following features:
* Custom dashboards, with evolving maps, for freight carriers, highlighting where they need to be to have the lowest travel time to meet our predicted demand.
* Identify demand time cycles independently per-shipper, and combine for changing predictive demand maps of demand. As you acquire more data, you can update predictions continuously. 
* Solve for 80/7 and 34-hour restart times in our predictive routing. For trucking firms with more drivers than trucks, we can help the trucks constantly run even when the drivers have downtime, and solve for the back transport of the displaced drivers as well.
* incentivize LTL shippers with procedurally reduced logistics markup to fill our trucks predictively to approach FTL cost-per-mile efficiency. This maximizes the trucks' back haul income, further encouraging them to reduce their use of other 3PLs. We can match NMFC code and filter the map for that demand predictively as well.
* Monitor when and where trucks drop in and out of availability to detect our 3PL competitor's freight patterns, and direct our sales teams towards shippers in those areas at those times. We can also model this using time anomalies in LTL freight shipping transit time, allowing us to infer other orders.
* Predict 34-hour restart time and allow individual truckers to route toward more desirable locations on their weekends, including custom results for specific firms, including a desire to route toward their homes, and even accomodating truckers desiring to gravitate to multiple home bases with separate target times.
